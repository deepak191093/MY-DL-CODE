Let's see, I was just calling to see, um, to get pricing on to have someone come out and take a look at my, um, residence for rodent. Okay. Yeah, I can definitely help you out. Um, let me get your zip code really quickly, and I can put you in the right service area. 95377 And then what is the home address that we would be servicing? 1267 Gentry Court and Tracy, California 95377 And then what is your first and last name? Patty? Last name is long rap. L u A N g R a T h perfect. Awesome. Um, good to talk to you. We can definitely help you out. Those rodents where they mainly been seeing them. Kind of like in the kitchen areas around the home. Yeah, in the kitchen area. Um, I hearing in the wall, like, upstairs in my room, but all the night and I hearing walls up in the top of the kitchen of the new There's like a law on the top. I can hear it there or I'll see, like, dropping behind, like sofas and stuff our TV. Okay. And how long have you been seeing this for? Um, for a few weeks already. Probably like a month. How do you like a month? Okay for sure. We'll definitely kind of try to get out there as soon as possible for you guys. Start the process. Taking care of these, Uh, Patty? What? We actually offers a quarterly service. So we come out every three months and at any time in between us for free. So, uh, now, every time we come out, we actually do start by inspecting and spot treating your property 30 fee out with the base of the home. This is actually what it's gonna give you guys a really good barrier between your home and where these rodents are coming from. We're also gonna put different bait boxes, perhaps stuff like that outside, just for any new ones from coming in. Um, now, of course, the interest around the foundation of the home services. Make sure nothing gets inside that way. And then we do prevent for all of your other household pets as well. So need, like your aunt spiders, millipedes, Roaches. Uh, so we're gonna take down all the spider webs from your window sills. Kind of just about anything from up there, getting inside the home that way. So is it pet friendly to have, um, stuff outside? Because I have dogs that are outside, so I wanna make sure friends. That's a good question. So that's actually the best part about our service, Patty, all of our products are botanically based, so they're super family friendly, separately, environmentally friendly. It'll actually help prevent there. Please antics as well. So yeah. No, for sure. Yeah. And then we will treat We did treat the inside garage, attic, all that kind of stuff as well. Um, as far as pricing goes normally, your initial price is about 2 29 and quarterly. It's about 1 29. However, Patty, we're actually having some really good holiday sales going on right now. We're actually doing our initial service for 100 and $30 off right now. So it's just that 99 bucks and that's still gonna be for everything outside, inside yard, the outside barrier, all those boxes, traps, all that kind of stuff and then tell you. Like I was telling you, you do have 100% satisfaction guaranteed. So if you ever see anything in between, our services will come back for free. And as far as how does this nine? Yeah. I had worked at $99. Excuse me. So how does this work? This 99 is just the days that, um, you guys come in, come out and do the estimate, Or is that automatically just setting out traps and everything at the same time? Yeah. So that $99 will be after we do, so we'll come out. We'll kind of take a look at things like, you know, how we're gonna exactly treats. And then after that, services completed. That's when you'll be charged at $99. Uh huh. Okay, so that's like a estimate. I mean, like, a kind of, you know. Yeah, right. Yes. Yeah. And so and so what is my next service charge would be? I mean, you say every three months that you guys come out and look at it, or how does that work? Yeah, So it's every three months. Um, and that's the 99 as well right now. for how long are you guys gonna do that Until, um, for the year? Yeah, a year. Because I want to make sure when you guys come out, if you're able to do the trap right away or do I have to wait for them to make another appointment for them to? No. Yeah. So that first appointment that we come out, we will do everything. So traps all that kind of stuff. Yeah. So that's always that's included. And then how to your first two services are gonna be about 30 to 45 days apart. That's a really important service, as you know, might just reproduce very fast. We have to come back, make sure that there's somewhere, like voted activity. Obviously. Um, and then after that, that's when you just see this every three months for the rest of that year just to make sure what happens. So what happens if they said so? What happens if they said the trap and there's rodents, like inside the trap from he's gonna discharge? Do we just leave it in there or how does that work? No. Yeah. So you just give us a call and we'll come back for free any time in between. Oh, okay. That's that's if I'm able to see it. But if they're putting in an addict or something, I'm not gonna see that until they come in. Look at it. Yeah, but if you feel like you know what, I think there's something up there. Give us a call. We'll come back. Check do all of that for you. So it's okay. And that's and and that's included in the 99. Yes. Yeah. So that was always Yeah. That will always be included. So you won't have any extra cars? Um, okay. Including all the bait boxes, traps, all that stuff included in your pricing. So so is there a way that, um, you guys have like, um, a pricing on that? Because my landlord, he's gonna be paying for it. So I wanna make sure I have, like, full information to get to him. Do you have any chance have those information? So what I can do is I can send it over to our scheduling department. That will be your branch in the Bay area. And they'll also send me like an email. Um um, because they do fill up very fast. As far as like, scheduling goes, I do know in the area. I'm sure you know, two. Uh, So what we do is we put in a request to date and time right now to see if we can get you scheduled for that. And then we would send you an email with all that information. And then if your landlord wants to just call us in and give a stat form of payment, we could do that too. Okay. So, uh, what is what would be your requested date and time for that? Um, do you have anything for Thursday? This Thursday? Thursday. So I can put in a request for this Thursday. And then your branch of the Bay area will let you know, Uh, if you got that within the next couple of hours and then what would be the time? Um, after four. Because I'm I'm at work. So perfect. So let's do after four and then let me get your email address. P underscore. My last name. L u A n g r a t h at s b c. Global dot net. Perfect. Okay. And you said, uh, the address is the 1267 three Court. Yeah. Okay, So I'm just gonna go ahead and send the information over to the scheduling department. So they're gonna out you just letting you know that confirmation for Thursday and and then if you would just have your landlord call and we do have to have a form of payment on file before we send a truck out to the home. So if you just want to have a call and then we can get that for your payment on file through him, that's fine. As long as I When I get the information, I'll forward it to him and, you know, go from there for sure. Contact you guys. Yeah. Alright, awesome. Sounds good. Only help you have a great rest of your day. Uh, we look forward to helping out. Very good. Thank you so much. You're welcome. Alright. Bye Bye. Mhm. Bye bye.\", analyzer=NaiveBayesAnalyzer())   "
